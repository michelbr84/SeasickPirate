One-Paragraph Narrative Summary
Captain Pip Finn longs to lead daring voyages, but the slightest sway turns him sea‑green. When a map to Whispering Isle arrives, Pip commits to sail with his crew. First Mate Lula turns practice into play with rhythm counting and one-minute-at-the-wheel challenges; Old Sal teaches a steadying breath; Cookie Ned adds ginger biscuits, lemon slices, and silly shanties. Mischief the Wave splashes up to tease and test. At Riddle Reef the crew must cross swaying planks in a breezy squall. Pip fears letting everyone down, but using breath, rhythm, and humor, he leads a lighthearted chant that steadies the crew. The chest holds a compass and a note—“Bravery smiles.” Pip accepts that he may still wobble, but with tools and friends, he can keep trying—ready for the next map.

Character Arc Checkpoints
- Pip: (Intro) wants to lead but feels green → (First success) one-minute + song → (Low point) retreat → (Reframe) tools + humor work together → (Climax) leads chant across planks → (Resolution) accepts ongoing wobble; ready for next map.
- Lula: Cheerleader → calibrates encouragement → times the chant, steps back to let Pip lead.
- Old Sal: Teacher of breath → observes Pip apply it → quiet pride as Pip leads.
- Cookie Ned: Comic comfort → learns timing → supports chant, not distracts.
- Crew: Over-eager helpers → scaffolded support in rhythm with Pip.
- Mischief: Teasing splash → rhythmic playmate; bows at the end.

Pacing & Layout Notes
- 32 pages; aim for 1–3 short lines per spread; alternate full-bleed action (sea/wave) with close, cozy scenes (breathing/training).
- Keep language rhythmic and readable for early readers; build call-and-response moments for read-alouds.
- Maintain playful, rounded wave shapes; no sharp, scary imagery.

Illustration Cues (high level)
- Color: Warm aquas, sunny golds, coral pinks; cooler tones only for the brief low-point scene.
