    "StoryStructureOverview": "A 32-page picture book with three acts: Beginning introduces Captain Pip, his seasickness, and the quest; Middle shows practice, setbacks, and playful wave challenges; Ending culminates in the Riddle Reef crossing and discovery of a symbolic treasure affirming courage.",
    "NarrativeSummary": "Pip Finn dreams of being a brave pirate captain but feels queasy with every ship wobble. When a crinkled treasure map to Whispering Isle arrives, Pip embarks on a voyage with his crew. Supported by First Mate Lula's rhythm games, Old Sal’s calming breathing trick, Cookie Ned’s ginger biscuits and shanties, and challenged playfully by Mischief the Wave, Pip gradually overcomes his fears through many small brave acts: singing, timing his stand at the wheel, and breathing like a whisper. At the climax, facing swaying planks on Riddle Reef during a squall, Pip leads the crew in a laugh-and-breathe chant, helping everyone cross. The treasure found symbolizes the power of small-brave choices and supportive friendship.",
