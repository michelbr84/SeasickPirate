OVERVIEW
Three-act picture-book structure designed for read‑aloud and early readers. The story follows Captain Pip Finn as he learns that courage can be a collection of tiny, repeatable acts—“tiny braves”—rather than one big heroic leap. First Mate Lula, Old Sal, and the crew form a supportive ensemble that models scaffolding and play-based practice. Mischief the Wave provides playful obstacle beats that prompt growth.

4) Departure & first wobble (Pages 7–8)

- Illustration cue: Darker tones below deck, Pip curled up, crew silhouettes above.

- Action beats: Big WHOOPWHOOP splash; Pip considers running; he remembers Old Sal’s breath, Lula’s one-minute rule, the cook’s rhyme; he stands and holds the wheel, breathes, sings, and laughs as his hat flies.
- Small-bravery moment: Pip stands longer than ever; he steers through the wobble.
- Emotional beat: Tension transforms to triumph; reader experiences relief and pride.
