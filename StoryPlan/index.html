            <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Courage isn't the absence of fear—it's choosing to try, laugh, and keep going even when you're scared.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 18px;">
                A pirate who gets seasick learns that courage isn't the absence of fear—it's facing it with a smile. Captain Pip Finn is a kind and pint-sized pirate captain known for his enormous floppy hat and queasy tummy. He adores treasure maps and loves singing pirate songs, but every time the ship rocks, his tummy turns somersaults. Join Pip and his crew as they discover that courage comes from many small acts of bravery, friendship, and a good dose of humor!
