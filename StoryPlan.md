- Genre & Format: Humorous picture book / early-reader adventure; ~32 pages; 850–1,000 words

- Short Synopsis: Captain Pip Finn adores maps and pirate songs but turns sea‑green when the ship rocks. A crinkled map to Whispering Isle sets his crew sailing. First Mate Lula turns practice into play with one‑minute wheel challenges and balancing games; Old Sal shares a breathing trick; Cookie Ned brings ginger biscuits, lemon slices, and silly shanties. Mischief the Wave pops up playfully at key moments. Pip collects “small braves”—sing one line, stand one minute, breathe out like a whisper—until he can steer through a big wobble, land at Whispering Isle, and discover a treasure that celebrates his brave practice.

Title: The Pirate Who Was Afraid of the Sea
Author: Marin Bloom (placeholder)

— Page Break —
Captain Pip Finn had a hat so huge the gulls used it for shade.

He loved treasure maps and pirate songs and making his crew smile. But whenever the ship gave the tiniest wobble—WHOOP!—Pip’s tummy did a flip and his knees went jelly.

[Illustration note: Bright, cartoonish deck; oversized floppy hat; friendly gulls. Pip clutching his middle with a sheepish smile.]

“Easy there, Captain,” said First Mate Lula, tapping the feather in her parrot hat. “Today we try a tiny brave.”

“A tiny what?” Pip asked, wobbling.

“A tiny brave,” Lula grinned. “One small try. Then a laugh.”

[Illustration note: Close-up of Lula’s multicolored feather; Lula peppy, Pip curious.]

A rainy breeze jingled the bell. A crinkled map fluttered against the mast like a paper fish.

“Whispering Isle!” sang Cookie Ned from the galley window, waving a spoon. “Treasure, crew!”

Pip’s eyes sparkled. Then the deck rocked, and his face turned sea‑green.

[Illustration note: Map close-up with dotted path; Cookie Ned cheerful; Pip excited yet queasy.]

“We can go,” Pip said, voice wobbling like a loose plank. “But I may… um… wobble too.”

“Then we wobble together,” said Lula. “One minute at the wheel. I’ll count.”

Old Sal scratched his beard of tiny shells. “And breathe like this,” he said. “In sweet… hold… out like a whisper to the waves.”

[Illustration note: Trio at the helm; Old Sal gentle; simple breath arrows.]

They set sail. The Merry Minnow hummed. Pip gripped the wheel. The sea went WHOOP.

“Sing one line,” Lula whispered.

Pip sang, off‑key but brave: “Heave‑ho, hello!” He lasted one minute, then plopped onto a coil of rope, giggling.

The crew cheered. Mischief the Wave popped up with a cheeky SPLISH and winked away.

[Illustration note: Sequence panels of Pip singing, Lula timing, crew clapping; small smiling wave.]

Training time began.

Lula’s Balance Hop: hop left, hop right, hat catch!
Old Sal’s Breath: smell a sea‑apple… hold… whisper out…
Cookie Ned’s Kit: ginger biscuit nibble, lemon slice lick, silly shanty chorus!

Each tiny brave earned a clap and a laugh.

[Illustration note: Vignette montage of three mini-games; bright icons for biscuit, lemon, feather.]

Some days Pip stood a minute at the wheel.
Some days he peeked over the rail and sat right back down.
Every day, someone helped: a steadying hand, a rhyme, a joke that wasn’t too scary.

“The sea is alive,” Old Sal said. “And so are you.”

Mischief rose for a bigger WHOOSH and sprinkled the deck with glittering spray.

[Illustration note: Friendly larger wave with smiling crest; crew reactions comedic, not frightened.]

Then came the bumpiest morning yet. Clouds like crumpled sails. The deck rolled—WHOOPWHOOP!

Pip’s heart thumped. His hat slipped over his eyes. For a blink, he wanted to hide below.

He closed his eyes. In sweet… hold… whisper out…

Lula tapped her feather. “One minute, Captain.”

Cookie Ned slid a ginger biscuit into Pip’s palm. “For pep,” he sang.

[Illustration note: Rising tension; hat askew; friends’ gentle focus.]

— Page Break —
Pip stood.

He sang one brave line.
He breathed one slow breath.
He gripped the wheel for one whole minute… and then one more.

Mischief reared, playful and big, and SPLASHED a curtain of sparkles over the bow—WHOOSH!

Pip laughed when his hat flew off, caught it with one hand, and steered with the other.

[Illustration note: Full-bleed action spread; dynamic wave with friendly eyes; Pip mid-catch, crew cheering.]

The sea calmed. Whispering Isle winked on the horizon, palms swishing like friendly fingers.

The Merry Minnow nudged the sand. In a cozy cove, the crew found a little chest waiting like a patient puppy.

Inside lay a tiny mirror, a ribbon that read “For Small Braves,” and a jar of peppermint sweets.

[Illustration note: Warm island palette; treasure cove glow; symbolic items close-up.]

Pip looked in the mirror. His cheeks were still a bit pale. His smile was bigger than the sky.

“I still feel wobbly sometimes,” he admitted.

“Me too,” said Lula. “But look at you, Captain. You kept trying.”

“Tiny braves make mighty captains,” Old Sal said.

Mischief gave a gentle, goodbye splash.

[Illustration note: Group hug or cozy cluster; wave bowing.]

— Page Break —
On the sail home, Pip tucked the ribbon into his hat.

When the deck rolled, he did a Lula‑hop.
When his tummy flipped, he breathed like Old Sal taught.
When he needed pep, he nibbled Cookie Ned’s ginger biscuit and sang: “Heave‑ho, hello!”

Courage, Pip learned, wasn’t a roar. It was a pocket full of tiny braves.

[Illustration note: Closing deck scene; ribbon in hat; calm friendly sea; repeating motifs visible.]
