When the crew finds a crinkled treasure map to Whispering Isle, Pip must overcome his seasickness and fears to lead the voyage. First Mate Lula helps with playful jokes and rhythm games, Old Sal offers calming breathing tricks, and Cookie Ned provides ginger biscuits and silly shanties as secret remedies. Mischief the Wave, a playful splashy character, appears at key moments to test Pip’s nerve. Through many small braves — singing a brave line, standing a minute at the wheel, breathing out like a whisper — Pip's courage grows, helping him steer through a big wobble and discover a treasure that celebrates bravery.",
