### Story Overview

Captain Pip Finn is a kind and pint-sized pirate captain with a huge floppy hat and a queasy tummy. He loves treasure maps and pirate songs, but the rocking sea often makes his tummy turn somersaults. When a crinkled map to Whispering Isle finds its way aboard *The Merry Minnow*, Pip decides to lead the voyage—despite his fear.

First Mate Lula sets up fun jobs to help Pip practice bravery: counting gulls, tapping rhythms, and gazing at the horizon. Cookie Ned keeps spirits high with ginger biscuits, lemon slices, and silly shanties. Old Sal, the wise storyteller, shares a calming breath and balance trick, reminding everyone that feeling wobbly can be part of being brave.

Mischief the Wave, a splashy and giggly character, playfully tests the crew’s balance at every turn. Instead of one big heroic leap, Pip finds courage in many small brave moments: singing a line, standing a minute at the wheel, breathing out like a whisper. At Riddle Reef, facing swaying planks and a sudden squall, Pip leads a laugh-and-breathe chant that steadies the crew. Together, they cross safely and find a chest that holds a captain’s compass and a ribbon that reads: *“For Small Braves.”*

Pip learns that courage means facing the waves—sometimes nervous, always supported by friends, laughter, and tools—and that he’s ready for the next great map.
