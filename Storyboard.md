    "Prompt__User_Message_": "Book message:\nTitle: The Pirate Who Was Afraid of the Sea\nAuthor: Marin Bloom\nAge: 6–8\nGenre: Humorous picture book / early reader adventure\nTheme: Overcoming fear with humor; finding courage in small, brave actions\nMoral message: Courage isn’t the absence of fear—it’s choosing to try, laugh, and keep going even when you’re scared.\nCharacters:\n- Captain Pip Finn: A kind, pint-sized pirate captain with a huge hat and a queasy tummy. He loves maps, music, and making his crew smile, but the rocking sea makes him seasick.\n- First Mate Lula: Resourceful, upbeat first mate who uses jokes, rhythm games, and steadying tasks to help Pip face big waves one small step at a time.\n- Old Sal: A retired sea-dog storyteller who teaches Pip a calming breath and balance trick—and reminds him that brave people can feel wobbly too.\n- Cookie Ned: The ship’s singing cook whose ginger biscuits, lemon slices, and silly sea shanties become Pip’s secret anti-sick toolkit.\n- Mischief the Wave: A splashy, giggly wave that tests the crew’s balance. Not mean—just mischievous—pushing Pip to practice courage with a grin.\nBeginning: Pip Finn dreams of leading daring voyages but feels green the moment the ship sways. With a treasure map in hand, Pip decides to sail anyway. First Mate Lula sets up fun jobs—counting gulls, tapping rhythms, and looking at the horizon—while Cookie Ned whips up ginger treats. Old Sal joins to share steadying stories.\nMain conflict: Out at sea, Pip’s tummy flips as Mischief the Wave bounces the ship. The crew reaches Riddle Reef, where they must cross swaying planks to reach a chest. Pip worries he’ll let everyone down if he gets sick, and a breezy squall turns the wobble into a real test.\nResolution: Guided by Old Sal’s breathing, Lula’s rhythm, and Ned’s shanty, Pip leads a laugh-and-breathe chant that steadies the crew. He still feels nervous—but he steps forward anyway and helps everyone cross. The chest holds a captain’s compass and a note: “Bravery smiles.” Pip realizes courage means facing the waves—with tools, friends, and humor—and he’s ready for the next map.\nValidation notes01: Age group inferred as 6–8 for humor and simple coping strategies; aligns with picture book/early reader.\nValidation notes02: Assigned placeholder author name Marin Bloom as no author was provided.\nValidation notes03: Assumed light, comedic tone with personified wave; no illustration or length details specified.\nStatus: ready\n\nRequest: Please create an elegant, clean HTML page that shows a page-by-page outline of text approximations, suggested illustrations, and layout suggestions for the book. Format suitable for PDF, Figma, Canva, or PowerPoint import."
