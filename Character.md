1. Project Overview
- Target audience: Children ages 6–8 (early reader / picture book)
- Genre: Humorous early-reader / picture book
- Core theme: Overcoming fear with humor; finding courage in small, brave actions
- Moral: True courage is not the absence of fear but choosing to try, laugh, and keep going despite it.
- Short synopsis: Captain Pip Finn loves treasure maps and pirate songs but gets seasick whenever the ship rocks. When the crew finds a crinkled map to Whispering Isle, Pip must lead the voyage. With First Mate Lula’s playful practice games, Old Sal’s calming breathing trick, and the crew’s creative support, Pip learns to face Mischief the Wave through many small, brave actions—singing a line, standing a minute at the wheel, breathing out like a whisper—until he can steer through a big wobble and land at Whispering Isle, finding a playful treasure that celebrates his small braves.

2. Main Characters (production-ready descriptive sheets)

Captain Pip Finn
- Role: Main protagonist — pirate captain
- Short description: Small, earnest, and round-faced with an oversized floppy hat and a huge heart. Loves treasure maps, pirate songs, and peppermints. Gets seasick whenever the ship rocks; inventive, gentle, and warm-humored.
- Personality traits: earnest, inventive, gentle, loyal, humorous despite nerves
- Motivation: Wants to lead his crew to Whispering Isle and prove he can manage his fear through small acts of bravery.
- Visual notes: Round, friendly face; oversized floppy hat (key silhouette); striped trousers; small peg or wooden wheel; slightly rosy cheeks when embarrassed; keeps a small peppermint jar (striped glass jar with cork lid) on his coat or at the helm.
- Voice / speech style: Earnest, slightly breathy at anxious moments; quick shanty fragments when excited; pauses/stammers when nervous.
- Production cues: Give Pip clear emotional expressions and exaggerated hat gestures. Ensure his silhouette (hat + round head) is instantly recognizable across spreads. Show small, practical inventions (e.g., a hat strap, tiny wheel grip) to indicate resourcefulness.

First Mate Lula
- Role: Ally / supportive friend — first mate
- Short description: Playful, brave, and practical. Wears a parrot-feather hat, quick expressive eyes, and a colorful sash. Teases Pip with affectionate jokes and invents playful drills to help him practice tiny braves.
- Personality traits: playful, practical, encouraging, nimble, quick-witted
- Motivation: To build Pip’s confidence using humor and hands-on practice without shaming him.
- Visual notes: Parrot-feather hat (multicolored)—a recurring visual motif; nimble posture; energetic gestures; bright sash and boots; often shown mid-action (balancing, timing, clapping).
- Voice / speech style: Quick, bright, rhythmic; uses short encouragements and game-like commands (“One minute—go!”).
- Production cues: Lula is the visual and action coach—use her movements to demonstrate exercises and timing. Her feather can be used as a visual timer or cue in spreads.

Old Sal
- Role: Mentor figure — retired mariner and storyteller
- Short description: Weathered, kind storyteller with a long beard threaded with tiny shells. Keeps a small sea chest of trinkets. Offers tall tales and a simple breathing trick to calm nerves.
- Personality traits: wise, calm, reassuring, patient, wryly humorous
- Motivation: To pass on calming tools and sea wisdom that help Pip manage fear.
- Visual notes: Weathered coat, sea-stained cap, long beard with shells, walking stick carved with a fish, small sea chest covered in stickers. Often sits on the quarterdeck with soft lighting.
- Voice / speech style: Slow, warm, story-teller cadence; uses sea metaphors and gentle repetition when teaching breathing.
- Production cues: Old Sal scenes are quieter, with intimate composition—close-ups, soft light. Provide a small illustration diagram for his breathing technique (simple arrows or breath cloud).

The Crew (Finn’s Shipmates)
- Role: Secondary characters / ensemble — support network
- Short description: A cheerful, quirky mix: singing cook (round, jovial), nervous cabin boy (small, wide-eyed), dancing deckhand (slim, energetic), plus extras. They offer varied responses to Pip’s seasickness but are ultimately supportive.
- Personality traits: diverse (cheerful, nervous, inventive), resourceful, empathetic
- Visual notes: Distinct silhouettes and color treatments for quick ID by young readers. Include visual diversity in body type, skin tone, and costume.
- Voice / speech style: Mix of musical lines, nervous stammers, and boisterous support depending on role.
- Production cues: Use the crew for comedic beats, supportive scaffolding (steadying hands, silly shanties), and group reaction shots.

Mischief the Wave
- Role: Minor personified element — playful antagonist/challenge
- Short description: A splashy, cheeky wave with a smiling crest and expressive foam-eyes. Mischief pops up at key moments to test Pip’s nerve but is playful rather than threatening.
- Personality traits: mischievous, playful, expressive, non-threatening
- Visual notes: Smiling crest, foam-shaped eyebrows, expressive splash shapes; vary the size of Mischief (tiny splashes to a larger playful crest) to scale tension.
- Nonverbal voice: Emphasize sound effects (WHOOP!, WHOOSH!, SPLASH!) and expressive gestures rather than words.
- Production cues: Render Mischief with friendly shapes and bright highlights; avoid menacing tones. Mischief’s expressions should mirror Pip’s progress—more surprised/confounded as Pip grows braver.

3. Settings & Environments (production-ready)

The Merry Minnow (working title) — the Ship
- Type: Primary, central setting
- Mood: Cozy, slightly cluttered, warm, and reassuring even during wobble moments.
- Key spaces: Quarterdeck (story nook for Old Sal), helm/wheel (Pip’s challenge spot), galley (cook sings), below deck (retreat point during setbacks), crow’s nest (brief vantage).
- Visual texture: Warm wood grains, sun-faded paint, ropes, barrels, brass fittings, scuffed deck planks.
- Props & continuity: Hand-drawn map taped near the helm; peppermint jar accompanies Pip; Lula’s feather visible in the helm area; Old Sal’s sea chest on the quarterdeck.
- Illustration cues: Use full-bleed deck spreads for group action; close-ups for breathing and quiet scenes; maintain consistent placement of the map, peppermint jar, and feather to aid continuity.

The Sea
- Type: Primary environment
- Mood: Friendly, playful, dynamic—capable of surprise splashes (Mischief) but never menacing.
- Visual style: Rolling aquas, sunlit highlights, playful fish and floating seaweed, distant islands winking on the horizon.
- Illustration cues: Use full-bleed spreads for sea action and Mischief moments. Keep wave shapes soft and rounded to convey friendliness. Include friendly gulls and curious fish as recurring background elements.

Whispering Isle
- Type: Secondary, destination setting
- Mood: Welcoming, whimsical, peaceful.
- Key visuals: Palm trees that sway like whispering hands, golden sand, small treasure cove.
- Treasure treatment: Symbolic and playful (mirror, peppermints, ribbon reading “For Small Braves”) rather than traditional gold and jewels.
- Illustration cues: Warm sunlight, soft shading, and a gentle reveal moment when the chest is opened.

Below Deck / Quarterdeck
- Below deck mood: Quiet, safe, slightly shadowed for emotional lows (use warmer hue to avoid gloom).
- Quarterdeck mood: Cozy, storytelling nook with soft lighting—Old Sal’s domain.
- Illustration cues: Use contrasting compositions to show emotional shifts—low, intimate spaces for vulnerability and open, bright spaces for action.

4. Recurring Motifs, Props & Textures (for continuity)
- Pip’s oversized floppy hat — visual pulse (comedic beats, silhouette anchor).
- Lula’s multicolored feather — timing cue and motif.
- Crinkled map to Whispering Isle — stains, fold lines, dotted path; always shows Whispering Isle.
- Peppermint jar — striped glass jar with cork lid; tactile calming anchor used by Pip.
- Ribbon labeled “For Small Braves” — symbolic treasure, to be awarded at the end.
- One-minute at the wheel — time-based exercise repeated across scenes.
- Phrase: “tiny brave” — verbal motif to reinforce the book’s moral.
- Ship textures — knotted ropes, scuffed planks, brass fittings for tactile realism.

5. Character Relationships & Dynamics (creative notes)
- Pip & Lula: Close friends; Lula teases but supports—teaching through playful drills rather than scolding.
- Pip & Old Sal: Mentor/mentee—Old Sal offers calm tools (breathing) and gentle validation through stories.
- Pip & Crew: Respectful, affectionate; crew adapts to support Pip with songs, jokes, and practical steadiness.
- Pip & Mischief: Playful rivalry—Mischief’s splashes are prompts for practice, not true danger.

6. Tone, Mood & Visual Direction (art direction)
- Overall tone: Warm, humorous, and reassuring. Balance light tension (wobble/mischief) with quick returns to comfort and laughter.
- Palette: Warm aquas, sunlit yellows, coral pinks, and warm wood browns; use higher contrast accent colors for motifs (feather, peppermint jar).
- Illustration style suggestion: Friendly cartoon with textured surfaces (textured watercolor or soft gouache). Bold outlines for character clarity; maintain texture to give warmth and hand-made charm.
- Composition guidance:
  - Use full-bleed sea spreads for Mischief action scenes.
  - Use close-ups and soft lighting for breathing and teaching moments.
  - Maintain clear safe space for text placement on each spread.
- Avoid: Scary or jagged wave forms—Mischief should never read as a frightening monster.

7. Production & Continuity Notes (for editors & art directors)
- Keep character silhouettes consistent across thumbnails and final art.
- Always show the crinkled map pointing to Whispering Isle in scenes that reference the journey.
- The peppermint jar is a small prop; track its position continuity (on Pip’s coat or near the helm).
- Lula’s feather should be present in key coaching spreads to act as a visual timer.
- Keep warm lighting consistent in comfortable scenes; slightly cooler or muted tones during Pip’s low point below deck.
- Provide the illustrator a character turn-around sheet (front, side, back) for Pip, Lula, Old Sal, one crew character, and Mischief (multiple scale variations).

8. Accessibility & Diversity Notes
- Represent the crew with diverse body types, skin tones, and abilities to reflect inclusive casting.
- Use clear facial expressions and high-contrast silhouettes for early reader accessibility.
- Avoid cultural stereotyping; pirate motifs should be playful and imaginative rather than historically prescriptive.

9. Suggested Next Steps (production checklist)
- Approve final author credit.
- Decide final illustration style (vector vs. textured watercolor vs. digital gouache).
- Commission character turnarounds and color swatches (Pip, Lula, Old Sal, 3 crew members, Mischief).
- Create a storyboard (12–16 thumbnail spreads) using the motifs and continuity rules above.
- Draft front- and back-matter art (Old Sal’s breathing steps; Lula’s games) in the same visual style for cohesion.
- Prepare file deliverables: character sheet PDF, color key, storyboard DOCX/PDF, two full-spread samples (title spread + one action spread).

10. Contact & Attribution
- Keep author attribution editable in all files. Placeholder author: Marin Bloom (optional).
- Document owner: editorial team / creative director.
