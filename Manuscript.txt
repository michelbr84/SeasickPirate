Captain Pip Finn had a hat so big the birds used it for shade.  
He loved treasure maps and pirate songs. But every time the ship rocked, his tummy turned somersaults.

“Don’t fret, Captain!” chirped First Mate Lula, tugging a feather from her parrot hat.  
“Today we try a tiny brave.”  

“What’s that?” Pip asked, wobbling.  

“One small try,” Lula grinned. “Then a laugh.”

A crinkled map fluttered onto the deck one windy morning.  
“Whispering Isle!” sang Cookie Ned from the galley window.  
Pip’s eyes sparkled, but the deck gave a wobble and his face turned green.

“We sail!” Pip said, voice quivering.  
Lula smiled, “One minute at the wheel, sing a line, then rest.”  
Old Sal stroked his beard. “Breathe in sweet, hold, whisper out to the waves.”

The ship hummed. Pip sang, “Heave-ho, hello!” off-key but brave.  
Then he plopped on a coil of rope, giggling as the crew cheered.  
Mischief the Wave splashed nearby, winking and whooshing.

Lula’s Balance Hop: hop left, hop right, catch your hat!  
Old Sal’s Breath: smell a sea-apple... hold... whisper out...  
Cookie Ned’s Kit: ginger biscuit nibble, lemon lick, silly shanty chorus!

Some days Pip stood at the wheel a whole minute.  
Other days, only his nose peeked over the rail.  
Each time, someone helped—a steady hand, a silly rhyme, a gentle joke.

Near Riddle Reef, Mischief staged a big splash—WHOOP WHOOP!  
Pip’s hat slid over his eyes.  
For a moment, he wanted to hide below.  
Then he breathed, counted, and stood strong.

With laughter and breath, Pip led the crew across swaying planks.  
The chest held a compass and a ribbon: “For Small Braves.”  
“Courage,” said Lula, “is trying, laughing, and trying again.”

**Page 10**  
Back on deck, the sea was calm.  
Pip tucked his ribbon into his hat.  
When the ship rocked, he’d breathe, hop, or sing a line.  
Because bravely trying is the greatest treasure.
