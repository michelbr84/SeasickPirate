## Story Overview

Captain Pip Finn is a kind and pint-sized pirate captain known for his enormous floppy hat and queasy tummy. He adores treasure maps and loves singing pirate songs, but every time the ship rocks, his tummy turns somersaults. 

One windy morning, a crinkled map flutters onto the deck — a map to Whispering Isle. Despite his fear, Pip decides to sail. First Mate Lula organizes fun jobs like counting gulls and tapping rhythms to help Pip face the waves. Cookie Ned bakes ginger biscuits and sings silly sea shanties — a secret toolkit for seasickness. Old Sal, the wise storyteller, teaches Pip to breathe calmly and balance, reminding him that being brave doesn’t mean never feeling wobbly.

Mischief the Wave, a playful and giggly splash, tests Pip’s courage at every turn. But Pip learns that courage comes from many small acts — singing a line, standing a minute at the wheel, breathing out like a whisper. He steps forward, leads a laugh-and-breathe chant, and guides the crew safely across swaying planks at Riddle Reef.

At journey’s end, Pip and his crew find a treasure chest holding a captain’s compass and a ribbon reading “For Small Braves.” Pip realizes that courage means facing the waves with tools, friends, and humor — and that he’s ready for the next great adventure.
